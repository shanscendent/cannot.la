Recreated _some_ of the [magick.css](https://css.winterveil.net/) page in hugo markdown for reference. TODO: Move tedious stuff to hugo shortcodes

<blockquote>
In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?

## Fundamentals
magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing readability and the ability to convey information; _somewhat akin to the notes of a wizard_.

The framework retains its beauty and functionality across **all devices** and screen sizes, and works entirely **without JavaScript**. It is inspired by [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like [concrete.css](https://concrete.style/) and [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and the "usability as design" ethic of brutalism.

## How to use magick.css
<aside>magick.css works best with normalize.css, using it is strongly recommended!</aside>

The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html `<head>`:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/normalize.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/magick.css">
```
You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include it into your html `<head>`; as you normally would:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/magick.css">
```
You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this:
```
npm install normalize.css magick.css
```
And import them in your code:
```
import 'normalize.css'
import 'magick.css'
```
For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5 document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them!

## Layout
To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap all of your content in `<main>` tags, and then use `<section>` tags to break up long form content content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this.

(You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for typography and styled components only.)

Here is a simple example of the usual structure:
```
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <header> </header>
      <section> </section>
      <section> </section>
      <section> </section>
      <footer> </footer>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
To add tangential information, magick.css uses the `<aside>` tag. You will find it used from time to time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide additional context, you can use magick.css's sidenotes.<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span> You can find out more about this in the [Extras](#extras) section below.
<span class="sidenote">Sidenotes are automagically numbered! </span>

## Typography
Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers:

<div class="typography-columns">
<div>

# Heading 1: A title bold and grand, the story's gate.
## Heading 2: A subtitle beneath, where chapters await.
### Heading 3: With secrets whispered, plots thicken here.
#### Heading 4: Fine details shared, the message stands clear.

</div><div>

Paragraphs flow, a river of text,

[Links like portals, where will we go next?](#)

**Strong as stone, our words firmly stand,**

_Emphasized whispers, softly they land._

__Underlined secrets, subtly hinted,__

<small>Small, yet mighty, our words are minted.</small>

`Code speaks in logic, crisp and neat,`

Typography's spell, now complete.

</div></div>

Headings below `<h4>` are not styled by magick.css; they are usually not needed for hierarchical structuring, but instead for very specific use cases. So should you need them, you can style them as you see fit.

<blockquote>
[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures [...] write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text.

</blockquote>

## Structured Content
### Lists
Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content:

- This is...
- ... an unordered list.

<br>

1. This is...
2. ... an ordered list.

<br>

<dl>
<dt>And this weird fellow here...</dt>
<dd>... is a description list.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

### Tables
In a similar manner to lists, tables are clear and concise, directing reader focus to the data at hand:

| Potion            | Main Ingredient                           | Catalyst |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Glow Dew          | Bioluminescent algae (81mg)               | üúº        |
| Float Leaf        | Dandelion puff (61mg)                     | üùÜ        |
| Might Brew        | Ginseng root (78mg)                       | üùÄ       |
| Vanish Draft      | Mimosa pudica (26mg)                      | üúû        |
| Remembrance Tea   | Ginkgo biloba (39mg)                      | üúá       |

## Media & Figures
Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content, and an opportunity to add context using a caption.

Standalone
<aside>Floating images are not taken into account by magick.css, as they look best when used with justified text, which magick.css does not do.</aside>
Let's start with a standalone <img> element. It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its natural size; as long as enough space is available:

![an example, depicting a random subject](https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=1)

### In a Figure
Using a `<figure>` element, we can display the media element more prominently, and can also add a caption using a `<figcaption>` tag:

<figure>

![an example, depicting a random subject](https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=2)
<figcaption>This is the figure caption, it usually provides context.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Code, Quotes and Preformatting
### Code
Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To inline code, use the `<code>` tag. For larger pieces of code, use `<pre>` to wrap the `<code>` tag. By the way, you can also use figures to display code snippets!

<figure>

```
void fib(int x) {
    unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        printf("%lu ", a);
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
}
```

<figcaption>This C function generates numbers of the fibonacci sequence.</figcaption>
</figure>
(Line numbering of code requires some extra preprocessing of the content, but it is quite simple to do, even just by hand. Find out how in the Extras section.)

### Quotes
For quotes, use the `<blockquote>` tag. Depending on the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the browser handle the formatting:

<blockquote>

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.

<footer>George Orwell, <cite>1984</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

Adding a citation is done using a `<footer>` inside the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how it's done!

Let's now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can't be dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem contents in a `<pre>` tag:

<blockquote>

<pre>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me‚Äî 
Yes!‚Äî that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
   And killing my Annabel Lee.
</pre>

<br>

<footer>Excerpt from <cite>Annabel Lee</cite> by Edgar Allan Poe</footer>
</blockquote>

## Extras
There are some extra features that you can use with magick.css. These require special classes and are therefore not part of magic.css's main features. This section will show you what extra features are available, and how to use them.

### Sidenotes & Auto Numbering
Sidenotes<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span> are a great way to add additional information to your content. To add a sidenote in your text, two things need to be done:
<span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote! On mobile devices, it gets pushed into the main column. </span>

- Add an anchor where the sidenote refers from:  
  `<span class="sidenote-anchor"></span>`
- Add the sidenote itself, right after the anchor:  
  `<span class="sidenote">Sidenote Content.</span>`

### Code/Pre Line Numbers
To display line numbers in code/pre blocks, You need to insert a `<span>` for each line, containing the line number. Depending on your preferences, this can be done by hand, using JavaScript, or on the server side. Here is an example:

<pre><span class="line-number"><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span></span><code>#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

Which is achieved by this source code:

```
<pre><span class="line-number"><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span></span><code>#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
```

## That's it!
I hope I could interest you in using magick.css. If you like what you see, please consider giving it a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/wintermute-cell/magick.css). It costs nothing and shows me that **someone cares**!
