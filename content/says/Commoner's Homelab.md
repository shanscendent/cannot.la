A homelab is one or more servers that you set up at home and maintain for personal use. People use it for selfhosting applications to reduce their reliance on cloud services, or just to tinker, experiment and learn! If you're interested in setting one up, I have some recommendations for you.

If you read the posts on [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), you'd be inclined to think that you need server racks filled with enterprise hardware. Sure, they're powerful, but consumer hardware is enough for the vast majority of people. They're cheaper and consume way less electricity as well.

I'll be going through some concepts and the lower end hardware I use, but if you have the resources, space and you don't mind the low [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor), go wild! This guide's main focus is on _value_ and _user friendliness_.

Logically, you need networking, compute and storage for your homelab.
