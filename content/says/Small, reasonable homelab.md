A homelab is one or more servers that you set up at home and maintain for personal use. People use it for selfhosting applications to reduce their reliance on cloud services, or just to tinker, experiment and learn! If you're interested in setting one up, I have some recommendations for you.

If you look at the posts on [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), you'd be inclined to think that you need server racks filled with enterprise hardware. Sure, they're powerful, but consumer hardware is enough for the vast majority of people. They're cheaper and consume way less electricity as well. Still, if you have the resources, space and you don't mind the low [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor), go wild!
